This is the patent, which was the reason to start this whole website. The 'Walking through walls training system' is kind of the most funniest patent applications I have seen (till now). Not only is the idea gorgeous, nope, even the description is a nice and hilarious read.

## Abstract
>This invention is a training system which enables a human being to acquire sufficient hyperspace energy in order to pull the body out of dimension so that the person can walk through solid objects such as wooden doors.
